## Virtual Hypixel V7
### WIP

---


## What is Virtual Hypixel?
This project is gonna be a small proxy to hypixel.net. Instead of connecting to `mc.hypixel.net`, you connect to 
`localhost`. This allows this program to read / modify packets, allowing many features to be added, such as stat checking, slight 
fps improvements and more.

## Why??
There's a few proxies like this out there, but Virtual Hypixel aims to be the most customizable.
You can customize basically everything about it, and you can even make your own custom modules for it!

## When will it be released?
This is still a WIP, but I will make a beta release soon (hopefully).
